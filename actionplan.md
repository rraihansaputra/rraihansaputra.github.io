# Wisdoms of HN: Action Plan  

## No more advice seeking unless necessary.  
 - No searching for 'best' 'top' etc unless stuck with current resource
- have a problem first, then look at advice/research
    - define a question before googling anything
- "Advice is useless without context
## start summarizing every article that I read (it's already on the google sheet)  
- start scheduling for this..?
## adjust diet  
- research on keto
- salad and protein instead of carbs and protein
    - vinegar  salt and olive oil to taste, still no sugar
- NO SUGAR!
- research on intermittent Fasting

## Moring routine DRAFT  
- Wakeup and STAND. No lounging around
- Drink
- Meditate for 10 mins, without guidance/anything
- stretch with the video thing #TODO add link/list
- Workout (do this everyday and add 1 set per week, increase reps per month)
    - 1m plank
    - 15 squat with freeweight
    - 10 pushups

## More pointers for thought
- 30 - 60 mins walk everyday -> commute to office with TJ?
- do more stuff in the real world
- eliminate stress inducers
- pick a bobby and do it twice a week
    - look into muay thai
- watch your posture

## Do something where small improements can be felt everyday  

# "Failure is an event, not a person"  
- Keep a win list #TODO  

## Extract the intrusive thoughts  
- Write things that bothers me on a regular basis
- "All the bad things that I have done, All the bad things that had happened."
    - Journal the events
    - Attempt to identify why these memories are stuck or causes pain
    - What have I learned?
    - Just do it on a simplenote file

# "It's normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if your using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal - if he's living a normal human life. And if it's normal, how can it be bad?"  

## On Success
- Fulfilling relationships
- on money: enough to live on without constantly worrying

## On Happiness
- Bring happiness to others in some way
- DO NOT try to get happiness through achievement
    - this is a hard way to get a short term happiness
- Find things that makes me hapy, and none of them have long term impact #TODO schedule these in
    - meditation
    - **regular** exercise
    - gratitude journaling
    - philantropy  
  
"To reiterate, the things that work are the things that give you a little boost of happiness every day, and if you find the right ones you can get to a level that is good for you through constant maintenance."  
"Purchase your happiness separate from your goals, it's much cheaper that way."

# Group people to priorities; time is expensive
- #TODO group in CRM?
- Be kind and caring, with effort
    - Start logging events, fill people's details
    - revisit before meeting
    - praise people

## Write more #TODO schedule this

## Make stuff easier to do
### Workflow for everything ..well not everything
- Automate and delegate -> including projects (see Wanqu)
    - can't?

    - recurring? schedule it, on any time scale (daily, weekly,...)
    - SCHEDULE TODOIST REVIEW #TODO
    - **DO NOT REMEMBER!**

2. Disappointing someone
3. Annoying
4. No harm
